# Kiwi not opening

{% hint style="danger" %}
**This isn't the offical Kiwi Documentation website!**\
****_Although it isn't the official one, we still do have quite a bit around here. The offical one (which is actually branched off this documentation website) can be found_ [_here_](https://kiwi-development.gitbook.io/kiwi-documentation/)_._ \
__\
_Please refer to_ [_this_](../current-documentation-progress.md) _for the current progress of this website._
{% endhint %}

### Possible issues

**Antivirus blocking off Kiwi from being ran**\
Your antivirus could be reponsible for stopping Kiwi from running.\
\
**Corrupted files**\
****Again, this is due to your antivirus removing files from the Kiwi folder. Make sure to disable your antivirus and redownload Kiwi.
