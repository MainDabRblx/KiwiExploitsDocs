# Kiwi not opening

{% hint style="danger" %}
**This isn't the offical Kiwi Documentation website!**\
****_Although it isn't the official one, the documentation here is as detailed as the official one, which is actually branched off this documentation website. The offical documentation can be found_ [_here_](https://kiwi-development.gitbook.io/kiwi-documentation/)_._ \

### Possible issues

**Antivirus blocking off Kiwi from being ran**\
Your antivirus could be reponsible for stopping Kiwi from running. This is an extremely common issue that happens with a lot of people.\
\
**Corrupted files**\
****Again, this is due to your antivirus removing files from the Kiwi folder. Make sure to disable your antivirus and redownload Kiwi.
