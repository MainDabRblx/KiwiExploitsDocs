# Is Kiwi a virus?

### Is Kiwi a virus?

As a short answer, **no**. Infact, no versions of Kiwi contain a virus.

* **Kiwi contains code that is used to attach/inject a DLL into Roblox.** Viruses can also inject themselves into applications and processes, which is why MainDab is detected as a virus.
* **Kiwi is** **not a bitcoin miner**. **Kiwi is not a token logger** (or anything like that). Although Kiwi has a key system, any malicious ads placed on our Linkvertise or work.ink links are not placed by us. We have no control over that. Also, we need to make revenue to keep Kiwi afloat.
* **Most popular free exploits** **do not have a virus**, such as exploits found on [WeAreDevs](https://wearedevs.net/exploits). If they did, the Roblox exploiting community would have brought those offending exploits down. Kiwi included.
* **Kiwi is obfuscated to prevent other people from stealing code.** This is a common issue throughout the Roblox Exploiting Community.
* **Kiwi is also obfuscated to prevent the key system from being comprimised.**

### But what's with the antivirus detections?

**The antivirus detections are due to how Kiwi operates.** As mentioned previously, Kiwi contains code that is used to inject into applications. This will be detected by antiviruses as a false positive.
