# Error 268 / Unexpected Client Behaviour

### Kicked due to Error 268 / Unexpected Client Behaviour

This means that you have been temporarily HWID banned for 1 hour from Roblox.&#x20;

This can be due to you running too many functions on a script or some other weird injection issues.

Your Roblox accounts will **not** be banned.

### Fix

**There are currently no fixes for this.** However, you can prevent this by using either KRNL's or Oxygen U's API as they have better security.
