### Kicked due to Error 268 / Unexpected Client Behaviour

This means that you have been temporarily HWID banned for 1 hour from Roblox.&#x20;

* **This can be caused by running too many functions on a script.** Roblox will detect too many functions being ran.
* **This is also dependent on which API you use.** While WeAreDevs API and EasyExploits API are easily detected, KRNL and Oxygen U's API are less detectable.
* **This can also happen if another Roblox exploit you recently ran is running in the background.** Roblox will detect such things as well. Make sure to close them in the task manager.

Your Roblox accounts will **not** be banned, but you may have issues running that account on other devices as well.&#x20;

### Fix

**There are currently no fixes for this.** However, you can prevent this by using either KRNL's or Oxygen U's API as they have better security.
