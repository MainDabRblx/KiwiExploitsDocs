# Current Documentation progress

{% hint style="danger" %}
**This isn't the offical Kiwi Documentation website!**\
****_Although it isn't the official one, we still do have quite a bit around here. The offical one (which is actually branched off this documentation website) can be found_ [_here_](https://kiwi-development.gitbook.io/kiwi-documentation/)_._&#x20;

### Current progress with the (unofficial) Kiwi Documentation website

_Things here are still far from complete. If there are things that need correcting, please DM `Main_EX#3898` (as he is the one that's trying to make this place)._

_Here is the current progress for the (unofficial) Kiwi Documentation website:_

| Sections                                                                          | Progress      | To do                                                                 |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [FAQ Section](broken-reference)                                                   | ðŸ”¨\~70% done  | There are probably a lot of other issues that are still undocumented. |
| Kiwi X ([Downloading Kiwi X](broken-reference), [Using Kiwi X](broken-reference)) | âœ… 100% done   | A few corrections may need to be issued sooner or later.              |
| Kiwi X Keyless                                                                    | â­• Not started | Kiwi X and Kiwi X Keyless are essentially the same thing.             |
| Kiwi V2                                                                           | â­• Not started | Will be done once the other three things are done.                    |

I did give kiwixcoke (KiwiExploits owner) a copy of this documentation website, but I will continue keeping this up as part of MainDab's "unified" exploit documentation.
