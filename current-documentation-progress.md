# Current Documentation progress

### Current progress with the (unofficial) Kiwi Documentation website

_Things here are still far from complete. If there are things that need correcting, please DM `Main_EX#3898` (as he is the one that's trying to make this place)._

_Here is the current progress for the (unofficial) Kiwi Documentation website as of December 3, 2022:_

| Sections                                                                          | Progress      | To do                                                     |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| [FAQ Section](broken-reference)                                                   | ✅ 100% done   | Pretty much covers all issues that Kiwi has.              |
| Kiwi X ([Downloading Kiwi X](broken-reference), [Using Kiwi X](broken-reference)) | ✅ 100% done   | A few corrections may need to be issued sooner or later.  |
| Kiwi X Keyless                                                                    | ⭕ Not started | Kiwi X and Kiwi X Keyless are essentially the same thing. |
| Kiwi V2                                                                           | ⭕ Not started | Will be done once the other three things are done.        |

I did give kiwixcoke (KiwiExploits owner) a copy of this documentation website, but I will continue keeping this up as a "backup" website.&#x20;

(please don't yell at me)
