# Current Documentation progress

{% hint style="warning" %}
**This isn't the offical Kiwi Documentation website!**\

### Current progress with the (unofficial) Kiwi Documentation website

_Things here are still far from complete. If there are things that need correcting, please DM `Main_EX#3898` (as he is the one that's trying to make this place)._

_Here is the current progress for the (unofficial) Kiwi Documentation website:_

| Sections                                                                          | Progress      | To do                                                                               |
| --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [FAQ Section](broken-reference)                                                   | ðŸ”¨\~60% done  | There are probably a lot of other issues that are still undocumented.               |
| Kiwi X ([Downloading Kiwi X](broken-reference), [Using Kiwi X](broken-reference)) | âœ… \~95% done  | Pioritised first as Kiwi X is used the most. A few corrections may need to be made. |
| Kiwi X Keyless                                                                    | â­• Not started | Kiwi X and Kiwi X Keyless are essentially the same thing.                           |
| Kiwi V2                                                                           | â­• Not started | Will be done once the other three things are done.                                  |

Regardless, this website aims to get users to self-serve themselves instead of asking help for trivial things (and not getting a fast response).
