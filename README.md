### Welcome to Kiwi!

Kiwi is a free Roblox exploit for Windows with (exactly) 114 scripts to choose from in the script/game hub, from Blox Fruits to Pet Simulator X.\
\
There are three versions of Kiwi: [Kiwi X](https://kiwiexploits.com/kiwi-x-download.html), [Kiwi X Keyless](https://kiwiexploits.com/kiwi-x-keyless-download.html), and [Kiwi V2](https://kiwiexploits.com/kiwi-x-keyless-download.html). \
\
Kiwi X and Kiwi X Keyless are essentially the same thing, except that one does not have a key system (but a longer download process). Kiwi V2 has a newer UI compared to Kiwi X (such as rounded corners, more animations, etc) and comes along with more features. \
\
There are detailed, step-by-step instructions on downloading and using each of these different versions on this documentation website.
