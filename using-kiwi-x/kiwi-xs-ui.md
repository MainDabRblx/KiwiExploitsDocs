Once Kiwi X finishes loading, you will be greeted with this window.

The first part here circled in red is the **code editor**. This is where you can paste in Lua scripts.

On the bottom of the screen we can see a few buttons. For your convenience, here is a table of buttons and what they do.

| Button         | What it does                                                                                    |
| -------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Execute        | Executes the script in the code editor                                                          |
| Clear          | Clears the code editor                                                                          |
| Open File      | Opens and loads text from a file into the code editor                                           |
| Execute File   | Directly executes code from a file (.txt, .lua)                                                 |
| Save File      | Saves the content in the code editor into a file                                                |
| Toggle Scripts | Shows a listbox containing files in the Scripts folder (found in the same folder as Kiwi X.exe) |
| Settings       | Opens a settings page where you can change the API you use alongside other additional functions |
| Game Hub       | Opens a window with quite a bit of scripts for you to use (110+ of them!)                       |

You can open more code editor tabs by pressing the + button, and close some by clicking the X button.

Finally, we have the injection icon.

This will inject the currently selected API (selected in Settings) into Roblox.\

We can now move onto actually exploiting with Kiwi X, now we got the UI cleared out of the way.
