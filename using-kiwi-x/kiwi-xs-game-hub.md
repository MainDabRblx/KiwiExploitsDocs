# Kiwi X's Game Hub

### The Game Hub

Kiwi X has a large game hub with around 110+ scripts to use. You can search for specific games that you want to exploit in as well.

### Example usage

Let's try and exploit in Prison Life.

In order to run the script for Prison Life, all you need to do is click on the Prison Life icon (given you have already injected Kiwi X by pressing the Syringe icon).

That's all there is to using Kiwi X! Enjoy using Kiwi X to annoy people (or to cover up your apparent skill issue you have in rather simple games).
