### Going though the key system

When you open up Kiwi X, you will be presented with the key system. Click "Get Login Key."

The key system website will open up. Click "Click Here to Start".

{% hint style="warning" %}
If you are redirected to any other sites other than the Linkvertise website, those are due to ads on the page. It is not the actual download page. Go back to the Kiwi X website and click "Click Here to Start" again.
{% endhint %}

You will now be presented with a captcha. Complete the captcha to continue.

You could be redirected to a **second** captcha. Do it like the first one.

After that, you will be redirected to a Linkvertise link. Click "Free Access with Ads" to continue. You may have to scroll down to find the button.&#x20;

A popup will show up. Wait for 5 seconds, then close it.

After that's done, click "Free Access" to continue though the key system.

You will then be led back to the captcha page. Complete the captcha in order to reach the second Linkvertise link.

After that, go though the second Linkvertise link just like how you went though the first one. Again, you may need to scroll down to find the "Free Access with Ads" button.

After that, click "Free Access."

{% hint style="info" %}
You may be asked to go though the captcha again after clicking Free Access.
{% endhint %}

The key generator page will finally open. Click "I'm not a robot" and click the "Submit" button.\

You will now have the key needed to open Kiwi X. Copy and paste the key into Kiwi X.

After you paste it into Kiwi X, click "Verify Key."

That's all! Kiwi X should now be loading in.
