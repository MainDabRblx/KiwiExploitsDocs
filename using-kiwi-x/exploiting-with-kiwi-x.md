### Great, let's get started...

Hopefully you remembered what you saw in UI basics. Here are the numbered steps for injection and execution.

1. Select whatever DLL/API you want in settings
2. Click the inject icon
3. Wait for injection to finish
4. Paste in the intended script into the code editor that you wish to run, or run scripts from the Game Hub
5. Press the execute button

And that's all! The script should be executed. I'll go over in more details on how to do so below.

### Step 1: API selection

This will be important, as different APIs have different execution power.

#### What's the point of selecting different APIs?

As of time of writing, Kiwi X has four APIs : EasyExploits, KRNL, Oxygen U and WeAreDevs. All four APIs have different execution power. For example, EasyExploits may support a script that WeAreDevs clearly doesn't.\
\
More importantly, Roblox updates every **Wednesday/Thursday**. Exploits are then outdated (which is usually announced in the [Kiwi Discord Server](https://discord.gg/SAA8Vz4fGV)), in which the APIs (exploits) take usually around a few hours to update again.

#### How do I select an API then?

Simply open the settings window and select an API to use.

Once that's done, we will now start exploiting on Roblox.

### Step 2-5: Actually exploiting

{% hint style="warning" %}
If the APIs are not yet updated, they will crash Roblox, and you can get a 1 hour temporary HWID ban. This also happen when you run too many script functions at once. Roblox updates every Wednesday, meaning you have to wait for the API to update.
{% endhint %}

Let's assume that all the APIs are working. For our example, we will be using WeAreDevs API. It has actually signifiantly improved since 2021.

The first step to usin Kiwi X is to inject it into Roblox.

**First, you must open Roblox.** Exploits can't inject out of nowhere.

Now that we have Roblox open, we can now inject into Roblox. Click the syringe icon on the top right of the screen to inject into Roblox.

Once you see `[Fluxteam->WeAreDevs]: Injected!` alongside the console windows automatically closing itself, it means that WeAreDevs is injected. This will differ from API to API, but it should be similar in general.

We will first try run a script from the code editor. Paste in the following script into the code editor:

{% code lineNumbers="true" %}
```lua
print("Hello")
```
{% endcode %}

After you paste it in, click execute. Press F9 to open the developer console.&#x20;

If done correctly, you should see it printed to the developer console.

That's all on executing scripts!
