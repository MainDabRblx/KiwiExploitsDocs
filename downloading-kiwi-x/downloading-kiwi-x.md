# Downloading Kiwi X

{% hint style="danger" %}
**This isn't the offical Kiwi Documentation website!**\
****_Although it isn't the official one, we still do have quite a bit around here. The offical one (which is actually branched off this documentation website) can be found_ [_here_](https://kiwi-development.gitbook.io/kiwi-documentation/)_._ \
__\
_Please refer to_ [_this_](../current-documentation-progress.md) _for the current progress of this website._
{% endhint %}

### Downloading Kiwi X

There are two main places to download Kiwi X from, those being:\
\- [kiwiexploits.com](https://www.kiwiexploits.com/kiwi-x-download.html)\
\- [wearedevs.net](https://wearedevs.net/d/Kiwi%20X)\
\
Below are guides for how to download it from either sites.

{% tab title="From kiwiexploits.com" %}
#### Going though the Linkvertise system

Firstly, access the download link from [here](https://www.kiwiexploits.com/kiwi-x-download.html). You will appear on a page where you can download Kiwi X. Click the "Download" button.

Afterwards, you will be redirected to a Linkvertise link.

{% hint style="info" %}
If you are redirected to any other sites other than the Linkvertise website, those are due to ads on the page. It is not the actual download page.
{% endhint %}

\
This is how the Linkvertise website should look like.

Next, click "Free Access with Ads." **If you don't see it, then make sure to scroll down in order to see it.**\
****

Once you click it, a "Discover interesting articles" popup will show. Wait for 5 second, then press the cross icon on the top right.

After that is done, you will see a "Free access" button. Click it to proceed to the next page.

You will then be led to a page where you can download Kiwi X. Click the "Download Kiwi X" button.

Next, run the application just downloaded. It may look different depending on which browser you use.

This is what you will see after running it.

Click "Next". **Do NOT rush though it, or you may accidentally download some adware!**

Click "Skip All" in order to avoid the ads.

{% hint style="info" %}
Again, if you are redirected to any other sites other than the work.ink website, those are due to ads on the page. It is not the actual download page.
{% endhint %}

\
Next, a work.ink link should load up.&#x20;

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/chrome_8DGi17aJ4J.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

**Please note that your adblocker must be turned off in order to access the work.ink website.** If you still have troubles accessing the link, use another web browser.\
\
Once it's loaded, you will have to click "install Browser Addon" in order to continue. \
\
Again, if you are redirected to any other websites other than the Google Web Store (or any other extension place your browser uses), ignore it, go back to the work.ink page and click "install Browser Addon" again.

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/chrome_Zc6kevmGJc.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Continue to the extension place your browser uses.\
\
Add the extension to whatever browser you are using. **Make sure to remove the extension after you're done going though the work.ink link.**

<figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/chrome_y8U6CHAG2E.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

After that, go back to the work.ink website and continue with the Kiwi X download. The Kiwi X .rar file will be downloaded.
