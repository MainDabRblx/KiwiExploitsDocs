### Extracting Kiwi X

Kiwi X is downloaded as a .rar file, which means that Windows cannot extract it for you. You will need to download other programs to extract Kiwi X.

In order to extract it, you can use either [7zip](https://www.7-zip.org/download.html) or [WinRAR](https://www.win-rar.com/start.html?\&L=0). If you have neither of them downloaded, I would highly recommend using 7zip over WinRAR, although more people use WinRAR.

Afterwards, open the Kiwi\_X folder. Continue opening up the folders.

That's all! Now you should be in a folder that looks like this.

Before we continue, we will add Kiwi X as an exception in Windows Security.
