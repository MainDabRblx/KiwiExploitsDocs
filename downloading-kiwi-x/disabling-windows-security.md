### Why should I disable it?

Read [this](../general-faq-section/is-kiwi-a-virus.md) on why you should.

**Please make sure other antiviruses that you use are disabled!**\
****Other antiviruses such as AVG, Avast, Kaspersky, Malwarebytes, or whatever you use must also be disabled alongside Windows Security.

### Disabling Windows Security

Because Windows Security detects Kiwi X as a virus, you will need to disable Windows Security or you will not be able to use Kiwi X. \
\
Firstly, navigate to Windows Security. You can probably find this by searching it up in your Windows search bar.

Next, go to "Virus & threat protection".

Click "Manage settings" under "Virus & threat protection settings".

After that, disable everything you see (just to be safe that everything really is disabled).

**Please note that real-time protection will automatically turn on again!** We will later go over adding Kiwi X as an "exception" in Windows Security.

That's done! Now to actually downloading Kiwi X.
